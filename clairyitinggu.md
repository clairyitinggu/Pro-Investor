Hi, my name is Yiting Gu or call me Clair. I have done a static website using bootstrap, JavaScript and also HTML and CSS before. The language I am using right now is Java, python, JavaScript, not too many experience about database, but I am trying to get familiar with MySQL and MongoDB,and also React. I took a nutrition class last semester which I think I might apply this to my final project, but I also have an idea to create an app to help students in Amherst to share information such as sell books, furnitures or looking for a ride to somewhere. I am open to any other ideas,too.
